<hr>
<h3>Need for speed</h3>
<p>This has been my favourite movie for years now <br>kinda have a thing for automobiles</p>
<h3>A space Odyssey (1968)</h3>
<p>It's sci-fi. <br>A great movie made with the meeting of two brilliant minds. <br>Stanley Kubrick and sci-fi seer Arthur Clarke. <br>Kubrick's frightening clinical vision of the future - AI and all - feels prophetic for a many years on.</p>
<h3>The Godfather (1972)</h3>
<p>It's a thriller. <br> Btw, The Godfather's authority lives on.</p>
